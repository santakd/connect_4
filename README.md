# Welcome to Connect 4!
Get ready to drop it like it’s hot—strategically, of course. This isn’t just a game of colorful discs; 
it’s a fast-paced battle of wits where every move counts. Stack, block, and outsmart your opponent as you
race to connect four in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—before they do. 
Easy to learn, sneaky-hard to master, and guaranteed to spark a little friendly rivalry.
So line up your discs, scan the grid, and make your move. Four connects wins it all—let the showdown begin! 🔴🟡
