# Welcome to Connect 4!
Get ready to drop it like it’s hot—strategically, of course. This isn’t just a game of colorful discs; 
it’s a fast-paced battle of wits where every move counts. Stack, block, and outsmart your opponent as you
race to connect four in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—before they do. 
Easy to learn, sneaky-hard to master, and guaranteed to spark a little friendly rivalry.
So line up your discs, scan the grid, and make your move. Four connects wins it all—let the showdown begin! 🔴🟡

## Technical Summary
A solid Minimax implementation for the AI. It emulates Connect 4 correctly, including animations, menus, 
and game modes (Human vs Human, Human vs AI, AI vs AI). The recent updates (e.g., depth-adjusted terminal scoring, 
column ordering for pruning, and window-based heuristic) have strengthened the AI, making it capable of blocking
obvious threats and playing more strategically in hard mode.
